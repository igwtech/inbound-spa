# Product Context: Inbound SPA

## 1. Problem Statement

API users of the Woodlandsoftware platform currently lack a centralized, self-service portal to manage their accounts and API-related resources. This leads to a dependency on the support team for common tasks such as creating accounts, generating API tokens, and configuring webhooks. This process is inefficient for both the users and the support team, and it creates a barrier to entry for new developers who want to integrate with the platform.

## 2. Vision

The Inbound SPA will empower API users by providing them with a modern, intuitive, and self-service portal to manage their integration with the Woodlandsoftware platform. This will streamline the onboarding process, reduce the support load, and improve the overall developer experience.

## 3. User Experience Goals

The application should be:

- **User-Friendly:** The interface should be clean, intuitive, and easy to navigate, even for users who are not familiar with the Woodlandsoftware platform.
- **Self-Service:** Users should be able to perform all the core tasks without needing to contact support.
- **Responsive:** The application should be fully responsive and accessible on all modern devices and screen sizes.
- **Branded:** The application should have a professional look and feel that is consistent with the Woodlandsoftware brand.
