## 1. What Works

- The Vue 3 project has been successfully initialized with all the necessary dependencies.
- The API client has been generated from the `openapi.json` specification.
- The project has been structured according to the Hexagonal Architecture principles.
- The Memory Bank has been created to document the project's context.
- User authentication is fully functional.
- The API token management view is implemented with mocked data.
- Post management is implemented with mocked data.
- Client and hub management is implemented with mocked data.

## 2. What's Left to Build

- Webhook configuration
- Woodlandsoftware branding
- Comprehensive testing
- Integration with the actual API for token management

## 3. Current Status

The project is in the feature implementation phase. The user authentication, API token management, post management, and client and hub management features are complete. The next step is to implement the webhook configuration feature.

## 4. Known Issues

- The API token management feature is using mocked data due to the absence of the required API endpoints in the `openapi.json` specification.
